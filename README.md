# SMS_Spam_Filter
This project was initially completed to demonstrate knowledge of probability and use of a multinominal Naive Bayes algorithm to create a program to filters messages as spam or ham(non-spam). I made use of basic functions in python along with the built-in module: re, to build a spam filter that sorted new messages as spam or ham based on set constants and parameters. The spam filter was tested for accuracy by comparing it to previously assigned labels for the datasets done by humans. The spam filter ultimately had a accuracy of 98.74% which exceeded the expected goal of greater than 80%.
